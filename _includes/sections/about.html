  With a background in sociology and communications, I'm fascinated by how technology forms social practices and norms.
In particular, the language of data (big or small, commercial or personal) has been increasingly embedded into our daily lives. 
Currently I'm working on my PhD project investigating urban spaces emerged through digital mobility drawing on feminist technoscience concepts and applying digital methods.

<p>
  Throughout my career, I've been taken consultant and manager roles in strategy, analytics and product development working with people with a variety of professional and cultural background including data scientists, designers, aid workers and sales managers
(<a href="https://lubynoel-portfolio.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/CV-ElNo.pdf">See my CV in PDF</a>). The common thread was to make data and analytics accessible and useful (instead of mysterious and threatening) to people through visualisation, stories, products and so on.

<p>
  So far I've spent 60% my life in Korea, 21% in the UK, 16% in China and 3% in Kenya.

<p>
  Outside work, I love looking after my plants, seeing plays and playing tennis.
