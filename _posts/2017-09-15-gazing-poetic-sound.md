The project suggests a new way of engaging with the poetic text - observing sound dynamics and patterns in visual forms. It shows a range of phonetic features and relations throughout the Korean lyric poem 'The night the owl cried' written by Joonkwan Lee (부흥이 우는 밤, 이준관 시인). 567 Korean letters ('Hangul'), of which 335 are consonants and 232 are vowels, have been turned into custom symbols and arranged on staves. The visualisation will let you explore the ways the sound works with the meaning. If you don't understand the Korean language, try and imagine what the meaning might be just by looking at the sounds but really closely.
