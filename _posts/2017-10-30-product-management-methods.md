[OrgVue](https://www.orgvue.com/) is a cloud-based data analytics software specialising in org modelling. The team behind is 30 developers. Until 2017, it didn't have a concept of product management or roadmap. As a first product manager for OrgVue, I've brought structure and rigour to the ideas to launch process to the team.

### 1. Product roadmap

Pitched to stakeholders on importance of having a roadmap that can be communicated internally and externally, and come up with a sharable product roadmap.

### 2. Backlog prioritisation methods

Implemented structured process to collect, categorise and prioritse backlog items.

Depending on the product, used different approach for determining priority.

### 3. Continuous innovation

Being a B2B software implemented with advisory (analytics) services, capturing and embedding new IPs from the projects is critical to continuous product innovation. I've defined IP-led product innovation process.
